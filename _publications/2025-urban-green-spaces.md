This study examines public perceptions of cultural ecosystem services (CES) from urban green spaces (UGS) in Suwon, Korea, and Karlsruhe, Germany, through a map-based PPGIS questionnaire. The research reveals that Karlsruhe residents visited UGS more frequently and spent more time there than Suwon residents, with cultural and socio-demographic factors significantly shaping human-nature interactions. The findings support theoretical perspectives such as the biophilia hypothesis, social ecology, and environmental psychology, providing insights for creating inclusive, culturally responsive, and ecologically meaningful urban environments.
