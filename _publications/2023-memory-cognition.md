This study investigates individual differences in word-frequency effects in second language (L2) visual word recognition. We compared traditional proficiency measures with lexical processing efficiency as indicators of L2 lexical quality, providing new insights into how L2 speakers process visual words.

**Role**: Second author - Analyzed data and proposed a new approach to measuring L2 lexical quality
